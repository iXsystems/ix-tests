README for adding new tests and classes
############################################################

Adding new REST API tests for FreeNAS is relatively easy.

First, locate the correct test "class" you think your tests
should be added to. I.E. is this 'storage' or 'nfs'?

If that module exists, then you can edit it and add your new
test within. 


Adding new Tests
################################

Example #1
  (This is an example of calling a REST API function and testing the response)

  # This is the unique name of the test (Required)
  echo_test_title "Example API test"
  
  # This is the RESTY call when doing API requests of FreeNAS
  # RESTY Docs: https://github.com/micha/resty
  rest_request "PUT" "/storage/permission/" '{ "mp_path": "/mnt/tank", "mp_acl": "unix" }'

  # This is where we confirm the specific REST call returned a proper response
  check_rest_response "201 Created" || return 1

Example #2
  (This is an example of running a FreeBSD command to verify that a
   previous API test worked properly)

  # This is the unique name of the test (Required)
  echo_test_title "Example FreeBSD test"

  # Now we are going to test mounting a particular share from FreeNAS
  # ${ip} is the address of the FreeNAS System
  rc_test "mount_nfs ${ip}:/mnt/tank/share /tmp/nfs-mnt.$$" || return 1



Add a new Class of Tests
################################

If you want to add an entirely new class of FreeNAS tests, then the
"example" file should be copied and edited to your liking. Replace
all the example_* function calls to match the filename of your
test though. I.E. if the filename is "foo" then example_tests()
and example_init() would become foo_tests() and foo_init() respectively. 

Lastly you will need to change set_test_group_text to some unique
class name, which will help it stand out in Jenkins results.
  
  # Set the "class name" for these tests
  set_test_group_text "Foo tests"
